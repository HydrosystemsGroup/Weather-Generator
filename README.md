Weather Generator Package
=========================

Jeffrey D. Walker, PhD

This package will contain functions for generating synthetic daily timeseries of precipitation and air temperature under future climate change scenarios. These timeseries can then be used for performing a climate stress test.

This package is under heavy development and should not be used until its official release.
