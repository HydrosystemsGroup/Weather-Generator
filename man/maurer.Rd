}
\description{
This dataset contains a subset of the monthly meteorological datasets created
by Maurer et al. (2002). Only locations in the east region with latitudes
above 40 N are included. This dataset was automatically generated
using the makefile and r scripts located in the \code{/scripts/maurer_mon/}
directory.
}
\details{
The object \code{maurer} is a two-element list containing

}
}
\section{Measures}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{PRCP}: precipitation (mm)
  \item \code{TMIN}, \code{TMAX}: minimum and maximum temperature (degC)
  \item \code{WIND}: wind speed (m/s)
